## Requirements
Some player classes are using [NumPy](https://numpy.org/install/)'s arrays, you need to install it.\
Moreover, if you want to run our tests you have to install [Pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/6.2.x/getting-started.html).

## Game Rules changes
The difference between the original Ultimate Tic Tac Toe's game and this one is that every turn the player can choose any local board to play.
In this game, you can't play in a local board that already has a winner.

## Boards and Game Classes
This repository has three boards classes and a Game class:
#### Board
Generic board class, used as a base class of the other two.
* Methods:
``` py 
def check_winner(self)
```
The **check_winner** method checks if the board has a winner or has no more valid moves.

#### Mini
This class represents the local board.
* Methods:
```py
def play(self,row,col,player)
```
The **play** method makes plays in the board. The arguments **row** is the row that you want to make your play *(1 <= row <= 3)*, **col** is the column you want to play *(1<= col <= 3)* and **player** is your team's mark ("X" or "O"). 


#### Mega
This class represents the global board. The Mega board has a attribute called **grid_mega** that is a 3x3 list of local boards where the plays will happen.
* Methods:
```py
def play(self,wich,row,col,player)
```
Almost the same as Mini's play, but this one has a argument called **wich** that represents the local board that you want to play *( 1 <= wich <= 9)*.
```py
def show()
```
The **show** method print the global board with the all local boards inside.\
Example:![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85133393/146601927-466582e2-f75b-458f-be4a-603e7f56571d.png)\
When a local board has a X shape, the X player has won that local board. Same to local board with O shape.

#### Game
This class represents an Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe game.
* Initialize:
To initialize a Game class you have to pass two [players](#players-classes) as argument. For example:
```py
game = Game(player1, player2)
```
* Methods:
```py
def reset(self)
```
The **reset** method clean the entire game and keep the players that were playing.
```py
def playing(self)
```
The **playing** method run the entire game and stop when someone won the game or all cell's are filled.
```py
def show_winner(self)
```
The **show_winner** method print the winner of the game or when the game tied.

## Players Classes
This repository has three player types:
* Clumsy\
Makes random plays.

* Noob\
Always play in the first empty position in a valid board.

* Human\
Reads plays in the standard input.
 
### Initialize a player
To initialize a player class you have to pass "X" or "O" as argument to choose your team mark. For example:
```py
player1 = Noob("X")
```
